Sonification of Streamflow Data
===================
<i>Make music from decades of streamflow and water quality data.</i>

Out of an interest in the interface of science and music, this project sonifies hydrological data from Iowa. 
The result is a python-based workflow where users can produce, play, and save (in wav or midi format) music from 10 years of daily streamflow data of a currated dataset of 32 USGS gages in the Des Moines River Watershed.
