A web framework with serious gaming for ethical decision making

<i>Harness crowd intelligence for decision support in smart water systems.</i>

With increasing deployment of smart sensors and controls, water systems will have greater potential to effect human lives.
Yet, humans will be further distanced from decisions due to these new technological and algorithmic layers. 
Combined, these trends challenge water professionals to incorporate concepts of ethics and normative preferences into decision-support tools.

Water Ethics Web Engine $(WE)^2$ is an integrated and generalized web framework to incorporate voting-based ethical and normative preferences into water resources decision support.

Preliminary testing indicates that the framework can capture crowd 'intelligence' within learned models to use in decision making.
