Water Ethics Web Engine: an ethical decision-making framework with serious gaming
========
<i>a web framework to incorporate voting-based ethical and normative preferences into smart water decision support</i>

With increasing deployment of smart sensors and controls, water systems will have ever-greater potential to effect human lives.
Yet, humans will be further distanced from decisions. 
Combined, these trends challenge decision-support tools to incorporate the concepts of ethical and normative expectations.

Water Ethics Web Engine $(WE)^2$ is an integrated and generalized web framework to incorporate voting-based ethical and normative preferences into water resources decision support.

Preliminary testing indicates that the framework can capture group ‘wisdom’ within learned models to use in decision making.
