<i>an operational rainfall-runoff model and simulation engine in JavaScript</i>

HLM-Web is a simulation engine capable of running full-scale hydrological models natively in any browser.
Completely developed using modern web standards, HLM-Web is a new alternative for web-based simulation in hydrology.

Highlights
-----------
- HLM-Web is simulation engine for rainfall-runoff modelling in JavaScript. 
- It runs full scale, physically based rainfall-runoff models.
- All computations are performed on the client-side within the browser.
- Use cases can facilitate hydrologic education and research “sandboxing”.
