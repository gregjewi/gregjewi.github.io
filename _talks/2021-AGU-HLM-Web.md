Computational hydrologic models and simulations are fundamental pieces of the workflow of contemporary hydroscience research and education. In support of hydrologic modeling efforts, web-enabled tools for data processing, storage, computation, and visualization have proliferated. Most of these efforts rely on server resources for computation and data tasks, and client machinesâ€™ resources for visualization. Yet, continued advancements of in-browser, client-side compute performance present an opportunity to leverage these resources. Towards this end, we present an operational hydrologic model within a simulation engine running entirely on client-side using the JavaScript programming language. Further, we present an easy-to-use, in-browser interface for the core simulation engine to support educational and outreach applications. Though the use case presented here is self-contained, the core technology of the simulation engine can extend to leverage multi-core processing on single machines and networking capabilities of multiple clients or JavaScript enabled servers. These possibilities suggest client-side hydrologic simulation can play a central role in a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem of web-ready hydrologic tools.
