Recently, web-enabled tools have proliferated to support various environmental modelling tasks (eg, data storage, data preprocessing, computation, and visualization.) Most of these tools rely on server-side resources to operate. In a traditional web architecture design, the client's machine (via a web browser,) is used only as a control or interaction layer for the user and not for the computation task itself. However, the continued advancement in client-side web technologies provides ever-greater opportunities to leverage users' machines via their browser for computationally heavy tasks such as modelling.
