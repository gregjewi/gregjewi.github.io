Recently, web-enabled tools for data processing, storage, computation, and visualization have proliferated to support web-based environmental modelling. Most of these tools rely on server resources for computation and data tasks. Yet, the continued advancement of in-browser, client-side compute performance presents an opportunity to further leverage client-side compute resources. Modern browsers also offer a rich and flexible platform on which to build interactive, user-centric tools making it a strong candidate to be the interface of choice for next generation modelling. Toward the goal of device agnostic web-based modelling, we propose an environmental modelling framework developed using modern web standards only. First, we present the development of the modelling framework using a Service Oriented Architecture. Next, we demonstrate the capabilities of client-side compute to simulate environmental processes, such as the rainfall-runoff generation process and advection-reaction chemical transport process. Finally, we discuss the application areas for this technology such as operational forecasting and community-level decision making.
