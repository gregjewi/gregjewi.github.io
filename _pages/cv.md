Education
======
* B.S.E. in Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Michigan, 2013
* M.S.E. in Environmental Engineering, University of Michigan, 2015
* Ph.D in Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Iowa, Summer 2025 (expected)

Work experience
======
* 2019 - Current: PhD Student, <b>[Hydroinformatics Lab at the University of Iowa](https://hydroinformatics.uiowa.edu/#)</b>

* 2023-2025: Senior Hydroinformatics Engineer, Xylem Inc.
  * Senior technical leader of the Wastewater Network Optimization, North America group.
  * Responsible for delivery of engineering solutions to water utilities, coupling traditional H&H and stormwater modeling technicques with a diverse array of data-driven methods, e.g., neural networks for inflow prediction at wastewater treatment facilities and machine learning to predict sanitary overflows within the drainage system.
  * Main developer of multiple packages for urban hydrology analytics
  * Improved group-wide processes for delivery and production via implementation of advanced logging features and internal QA throughout analytics and project stack. Significantly lowered downtime and debugging of group's real-time analytics offerings and client-specific project logic.

* 2017 - 2019: Research Assistant, [Real-Time Water Systems Lab](http://107.170.79.190/)
  * Studied the application of control algorithms to assist in decision support during wet weather events within the Greater Detroit Regional Stormwater System for the purpose of reducing combined sewer overflows. 
  * Produced a web-based decision support tool for stormwater operators which used algorithms studied.

* 2015 - 2017: Water Resources Engineer, GZA GeoEnvironmental
  * Staff Engineer in the Water Resources and Dams Engineering group
  * Completed hydrologic and hydraulic modeling for riverine flooding and dam reservoir capacity studies due to extreme precipitation events.
  * Other responsibilities included on-site project management for environmental remediation efforts and water budget studies for large industrial facilities.

* 2015: Dam Network Intern, Huron River Watershed Council
  * Built interactive webtool for operators of the dams on the mainstem of the Huron River.
  * Product increased intra-watershed, inter-institutional communication to foster system- and operations-scale resiliencies.

* 2014: Research Assistant, [HYDROWIT](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ivanov/HYDROWIT/HYDROWIT.html)
  * Primary field technician for the HYDROWIT research group on Green Ocean Amazon campaign in the Tapajos National Forest (FLONA Tapajos).
  * Deployed and maintained 40+ sapflow and other sensors on an intensive tropical forest research plot.
  * Developed novel method of sapwood area estimation given trunk diameter and wood density.

* 2012: Great Lakes Summer Fellow, NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory
  * Compared Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Regional Model (CHARM) to observed land and water surface temperatures from various sources.
  *  Analyzed and characterized CHARMâ€™s ability to reproduce
statistically similar results to observed temperature recordings in both air temperature and water
column temperature.
