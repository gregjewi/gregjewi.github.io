Hey!
Thanks for visiting this corner of the internet.

I am a PhD student in the [Hydroinformatics Lab at the University of Iowa](https://hydroinformatics.uiowa.edu/#) and part of [IIHR](https://www.iihr.uiowa.edu/).
I am interested in problems at the intersection of people, technology, and water.

Within these pages I hope you learn a little about the amazing projects I've been so fortunate to be a part.
Please enjoy, and feel free to reach out for questions.
