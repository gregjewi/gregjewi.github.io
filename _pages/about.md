Hey. 
Thanks for visiting this corner of the internet.
My name is Greg Ewing.
I am a PhD student in [Hydroinformatics Lab at the University of Iowa](https://hydroinformatics.uiowa.edu/#) and part of [IIHR](https://www.iihr.uiowa.edu/).
I am interested in problems at the intersection of people, technology, and water.
Within this page I've chronicled much of my professional work to date.
Please enjoy, and feel free to reach out for questions.
